## Prerequisites  

Run this line for required libraries:  
```pip install requests pandas xlsxwriter```  

## Description  

Running either script will generate a .xlsx file with a time grid for each runner and each category. It will also have seperate tabs for each individual category, with a leaderboard of the users times.
Desired user list can be changed by editing the .py files and adding a new person into the ```goats``` list. No other changes are required. The goats list line is near the bottom of each file.
